Clock shows `h` hours, `m` minutes and `s` seconds after midnight.  
Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

**Example:**

```c
   h = 0
   m = 1
   s = 1
   result = 61000
```

<p>

Can you find the needle in the haystack  
Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an array full of junk but containing one `"needle"`  
After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:  
`"found the needle at position "` plus the `index` it found the needle, so:

**Example(Input --> Output)**

```c
   ["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5"
```
